	Live your life.
</p>
<p class='text text_block_left'>
	Cityvate began with a simple motto: make life fun.  Too often we get sidetracked by work or stress or 
    outright laziness that we get caught in a rut of routine.  It's with this in mind
    that we help our users to make the most out of their lives.  Whether it's new things
    you have yet to try, or old things you loved yet forgot, Cityvate is here to help
    bring a spark back into your life.

	We're a close-knit group.
</p>
<p class='text text_block_left'>
	When you join Cityvate, you become like family.  No, we probably won't be able to house-sit for you, 
    but we will certainly treat you as we would our family (remember, let's not fight in front of the kids).
    If you have a question about how we do what we do or suggestions on how we could help you better, we 
    would love to hear it!

	We're young and growing.
</p>
<p class='text text_block_left'>
	Founded in 2012, we're the new kid on the block.  Where many businesses climb all over their customers to hit them with additional
    fees, we trip over ourselves trying to go the extra mile just for you.  If you aren't happy, we aren't happy.  We are young, dedicated, and (most importantly)
    growing.  We're on your side, let's have fun together.
</p>
