#Description

Cityvate was designed to provide its users with a subscription-based service that would provide pre-paid activities/ideas each month.  For a fixed fee, users could pick from a personalized set of activity options that could range from dates to outings to wine tastings.

The project was scrapped early Alpha due to lack of funding.  No live demo available.
